      Let's start a little brief history myself. First of all my name is Brian McGrane, I am 43 years old and I was born and raised in El Paso Texas, the third of four children. I love being outdoors, Snowboarding and mountain bikings are two of my favorite
      activitis that I enjoy in my off time. I have worked many jobs throughout my life, but I've never felt that I've had it a true career. Then I began researching new careers and a freind told me to look into coding. After researching it I really enjoyed
      the the design aspect and logical thinking of web deveplopment. Going to this program I feel give me the validation that I've been looking for in a career.
